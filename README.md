# Vault 81 Radio
by oddlittleturtle


# OVERVIEW
Adds a new radio station to listen to featuring orchestral music composed by Guilherme Bernardes. Music is not automatically available, you must discover Vault 81 first. Music will be playing on radios in the vault.

On your Pip-boy, you will find this station on radio frequency 81.82. Radios are buildable after you complete "Hole in the Wall".

# NOTES
- I do not support the removal of mods in the middle of a playthrough. Have a listen to the composer's YouTube to see if you like the music before downloading. If it isn't for you, give a pass to this mod. If you check out the mod anyway, start a new character if you decide you do not want it after installing or go back to a previous save where the mod was never installed. There are two script injections to formlists (like the workshop menu but are hidden). One is the help menu and one is a scrap list for radios. These will break if you uninstall and do not return to a previous save. You will either crash while scrapping or will not be able to scrap radios (have yet to attempt to break my game in such a horrific way). You've been warned!

- MP3 tracks were converted to raw WAV using FFMPEG. They were then compressed to high-quality, game-ready xwm tracks when I archived them for upload to the Bethesda site.

- Vault 81 Radio is buildable in workshops after completing "Hole in the Wall." There are two versions - clean and nuked. You'll find them with the rest of your radios in the menu.

- Check the Help Files for new "Mod, Radio Vault 81" to make sure the mod has loaded correctly. This is one of the injection spots. You will lose all your help menus if you uninstall and continue on the same save and no one else will able to add new information there with their scripts.

# COMPATIBILITY
Will not be compatible with radio mods that use the same frequency.

Will not be compatible with radio mods that switch out the Diamond City radios in Vault 81 with their own radio. I use scripts to grab the refs and deposit them into Vault 81's holding cell. 


Note: Radio Activators are not part of the precombines (or the player wouldn't be able to interact with them) and have been scripted to update from Diamond City Radio to the new frequency without touching the cell data. If you're curious as to what the scripts are doing, the source is available on Git Hub. (It's derpy but works.)



# LOAD ORDER
Self-contained master file with all-new records. Will jump to the top of your load order.

Recommend new game for best results and so that you don't mess up your current load order.
