# Vault 81 Radio
by oddlittleturtle


# OVERVIEW
Adds a new radio station to listen to featuring orchestral music composed by Guilherme Bernardes. Music is not automatically available, you must discover Vault 81 first. Music will be playing on radios in the vault.

On your Pip-boy, you will find this station on radio frequency 81.82.

# NOTES
- I do not support the removal of mods in the middle of a playthrough. Have a listen to the composer's YouTube to see if you like the music before downloading. If it isn't for you, give a pass to this mod. If you check out the mod anyway, start a new character if you decide you do not want it after installing or go back to a previous save where the mod was never installed.

- MP3 tracks were converted to raw WAV using FFMPEG. They were then compressed to high-quality, game-ready xwm tracks when I archived them for upload to the Bethesda site.

- Vault 81 Radio is buildable in workshops after completing "Hole in the Wall."

# COMPATIBILITY
Will not be compatible with radio mods that use the same frequency.

Will not be compatible with radio mods that switch out the Diamond City radios in Vault 81 with their own radio.


Note: Radio Activators are not part of the precombines (or the player wouldn't be able to interact with them.)



# LOAD ORDER
Self-contained master file with all-new records. Will jump to the top of your load order.

Recommend new game for best results and so that you don't mess up your current load order.
